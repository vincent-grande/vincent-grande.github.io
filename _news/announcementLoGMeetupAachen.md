I'll be at the [Aachen Local Meetup of the Learning on Graphs Conference 2024](https://log-rwth.github.io/log-meetup-2024/) on November 27 and 28. I am excited to present my poster on topological trajectory classification and topology inference on higher-order graphs at the poster session on Wednesday and give an associated talk on Thursday!
