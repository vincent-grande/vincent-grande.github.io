Our group is officially launching the [Aachen Higher-Order Repository of Networks](https://ahorn.rwth-aachen.de)! :tada: We try to collect a vast range of higher-order networks in the form of hypergraphs, simplicial complexes and cell complexes from all kinds of domains. If you have any data set that might fit this, we would be happy about any contributions, simply open a pull request on [github](https://github.com/netsci-rwth/ahorn)! :maple_leaf:
