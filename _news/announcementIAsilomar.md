I'll be at the <a href='https://www.asilomarsscconf.org'>2024 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</a> from 27 to 30 October! On Monday, I will be giving a talk in the session for Topological Signal Processing and Learning on my newest project, topological trajectory prediction. In particular, I will talk about how to infer the underlying topology of a higher-order network from potentially unlabelled trajectory data.
