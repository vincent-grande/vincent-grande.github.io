I'll be at the <a href='https://indico.fysik.su.se/event/8139/page/616-week-1-dynamics-and-topology-of-complex-network-systems'>WINQ workshop on Dynamics and Topology of Complex Network Systems</a> at <a href='https://www.nordita.org'>Nordita</a> in Stockholm from 29 April to 2 May. On Wednesday, I'll give a talk about relating local features and global topology of networks and point clouds: Learning from the harmonic spaces of Hodge-Laplacians.
