I'll be at [NetSci](https://netsci2024.com/en) from June 16 to 21. I am excited to give a talk at [HONS@NetSci](https://hons-web.github.io/online/program.html) on 18 June on "Hodge Learning: What the Eigenspectrum of the Hodge Laplacian tells us about higher-order network topology and geometry". I'll also be presenting a poster. :tada: :canada:
