I'll be at the ["Geometric Realisation of the Applied Algebraic Topology Research Network" Conference](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/the-geometric-realization-of-aatrn-applied-algebraic-topology-research-network/) at the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute) in Chicago from 18 to 22 August. I will present a lightning talk and a poster on [Point-Level Topological Representation Learning on Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02300). :blush:
