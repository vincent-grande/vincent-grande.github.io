I'll give a [talk at the Mathematics Lab Seminar](https://www.mis.mpg.de/events/event/hodge-learning-relating-global-topology-and-local-features-of-point-clouds) at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig on "Hodge Learning: Relating global topology and local features of point clouds."
