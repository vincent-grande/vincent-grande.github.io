I'll be at the [SALTO Workshop "Higher-order interactions at the crossroads of geometry and topology"](https://www.mis.mpg.de/events/series/salto-kick-off-workshop-higher-order-interactions-at-the-crossroads-of-geometry-and-topology) from December 10 to 12 in Paris. I'll be giving a talk on our recent ICML Paper [Point-Level Representation Learning TOPF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02300), but I am happy to chat about anything between TDA and geometric machine learning! :potted_plant: :fr:
