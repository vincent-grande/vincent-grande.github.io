Is there one 'correct' metric for Persistent Homology, or should we rather analyse and compare multiple metrics on point clouds at once? We change the metric, track the effects on the persistence diagrams and extract new information on orientation and orientational variance and strength of point clouds! A preprint of my joint article with <a href='https://michaelschaub.github.io'>Michael Schaub</a> on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16437'>Non-isotropic Homology</a> is now available on arXiv. :blush:
