I am coorganising [HONAI@NetSci 2025](https://hons-web.github.io/online/), a satellite on the intersection of higher-order networks and AI, at the [NetSci Conference 2025](https://netsci2025.github.io) in Maastricht. We are accepting abstracts for contributed talks until **14 February**. See you in Maastricht! :blush:
