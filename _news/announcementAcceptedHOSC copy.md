"Disentangling the Spectral Properties of the Hodge Laplacian: Not All Small Eigenvalues Are Equal" has just been accepted at ICASSP 2024, the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing. In the <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14427'>joint article</a> with <a href='https://michaelschaub.github.io'>Michael Schaub</a> we attempt to "track" eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian through the filtration of a simplicial complex, bridging TDA and Topological Signal Processing. And we have many pictures! :tada:
