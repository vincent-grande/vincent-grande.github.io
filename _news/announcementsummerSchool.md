From 4 August to 8 August I'll be at the [summer school on TDA in stochastic geometry and image processing](https://sites.google.com/view/aarhustda/home?authuser=0) at the [Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies](https://aias.au.dk) in Aarhus. I will present a poster on our recent [ICML paper on Topological Point Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02300). :denmark:
