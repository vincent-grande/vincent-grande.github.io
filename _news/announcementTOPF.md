A preprint to my new joint with [Michael Schaub](https://michaelschaub.github.io) paper ["Node-Level Topological Representation Learning on Point Clouds"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02300) is now available on arxiv!
We construct point-level features vectors quantifying the contribution of the points to the global shape and properties of the point cloud.
