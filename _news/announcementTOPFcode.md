I have released my first python package `topf`, which computes topological point features in point clouds based on our [recent article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02300). The code and  many examples are available [here](https://github.com/vincent-grande/topf) :blush:. Alternatively, install Julia and Python and simply run `pip install topf`. :potted_plant::tada:
