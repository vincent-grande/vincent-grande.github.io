I am a third-year PhD Candidate in the Computational Network Science Group of <a href='https://michaelschaub.github.io'>Michael Schaub</a> and a member of the <a href='https://www.unravel.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/ofgh/?lidx=1'>RTG UnRAVeL</a> (Research Training Group for Uncertainty and Randomness in Algorithms, Verification, and Logic).

My research deals with the analysis of networks and data sets with higher-order information. A central motive is to use a blend of techniques from algebra, topology, homotopy theory, and network science to explore the relationship between small scale connectivity data and other localised information, and large-scale behaviour and global properties of data sets.

If you are interested in my research and have questions, new ideas, or suggestions, feel free to get in touch! :)

##### Short CV

Before moving to Aachen, I obtained a Master of Science in Pure Mathematics at the University of Bonn and a Master of Advanced Study at the University of Cambridge, UK, both times focussing on homotopy theory, algebraic topology, and discrete mathematics. Prior to that, I did a Bachelor of Science in Pure Mathematics and a Two-Subjects Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy/Mathematics at the University of Göttingen focussing on algebra and Wittgenstein's philosophy of language.

I wrote my Master's thesis on G-global homotopy theory supervised by <a href='http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/schwede/'>Stefan Schwede</a>, my Cambridge Part III essay on Bott periodicity and the J-homomorphism supervised by <a href='https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~or257/'>Oscar Randal-Williams</a>, and my Bachelor's thesis on exact modules over Manuel Köhler's ring supervised by <a href='https://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/rameyer/website/index.html'>Ralf Meyer</a>.
