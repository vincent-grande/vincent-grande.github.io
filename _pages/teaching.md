##### Taught Courses
During the winter term 2023/2024 I will be seminar coordinator for the seminar on (advanced) topics in network science.

During the summer term 2023 I was teaching assistant for the course on Dynamical Processes on Networks.

In Bonn and GÃ¶ttingen, I was tutor for Algebra (2017/2018), Linear Algebra for Computer Scientists (2019), and Topology I (2020/2021).

##### Supervised Theses
I am currently supervising these theses:
<ul>
    <li> Outlier Detection for Trajectories using the normalised and weighted Hodge-Laplacian, Xinyan Lai</li>
</ul>
The following students have succesfully written their theses under my supervision:
<ul>
    <li> Comparative analysis of spectral methods for community detection with heterogeneous cluster sizes, Jana Hauer, 2023</li>
    <li> Determining the number of clusters in subspace clustering, Peihong Shi, 2023</li>
</ul>

If you are interested in writing a thesis on a topic of my research, feel free to contact me with a topic proposition. If you don't have a topic in mind but want to write a thesis at our chair, please follow the instructions on our <a href='https://www.netsci.rwth-aachen.de/cms/netsci/Studium/~lzyay/research-papers-and-theses/lidx/1/'>website</a>.

##### NetSci Mailing List

The Network Science Chair at RWTH has a mailing list for interested students for talks on current research. Feel free to send me a mail in case you are interested!
