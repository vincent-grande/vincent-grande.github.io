##### Taught courses
In the summer term 2023 I will be teaching assistant for the course on Dynamical Processes on Networks.

In Bonn and GÃ¶ttingen, I was tutor for Algebra (2017/2018), Linear Algebra for Computer Scientists (2019), and Topology I (2020/2021).

##### Supervised Theses:
<ul>
    <li> Comparative analysis of spectral methods for community detection with heterogeneous cluster sizes, Jana Hauer, 2023</li>
</ul>

If you are interested in writing a thesis on a topic of my research, feel free to contact me with a topic proposition. If you don't have a topic in mind but want to write a thesis at our chair, please follow the instructions on our <a href='https://www.netsci.rwth-aachen.de/cms/netsci/Studium/~lzyay/research-papers-and-theses/lidx/1/'>website</a>.
